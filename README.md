## Project Description
The goal of this project is to understand the kinematics of a quadcopter drone and implement a motion planning algorithm in a simulation environment to control the drone.

The learning objectives for this project are:
1. Identify the robotic system and the associated mathematical model for its kinematics, dynamics, and motion equation.
2. Identify the workspace and configuration space in which the quadcopter drone operates.
3. Describe the chosen algorithm for motion planning and control of the quadcopter drone.
4. Design, implement, and evaluate the chosen motion planner to solve a motion planning task and navigate a quadcopter drone.
5. Describe the latest developments in planning and decision-making for mobile robots, including a comparison between different methods.


## Project Implementations
+ A quadcopter drone model with kinematic and dynamic equations
+ The Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) motion planning algorithm
+ The Model Predictive Control (MPC) control algorithm
+ A simulation environment to test the motion planning and control algorithms
+ A report and presentation describing the quadcopter drone model, the chosen motion planning and control algorithms, and the results of the simulation tests.
